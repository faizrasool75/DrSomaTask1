# ✅ WEBSITE DEPLOYMENT FIXED!

## 🎉 **THE ISSUE IS RESOLVED**

I've redeployed your website with the correct file structure. The 404 error was because the gh-pages branch had incorrect files.

---

## ✅ **WHAT I FIXED**

1. ✅ **Deleted old gh-pages branch** (had wrong structure)
2. ✅ **Rebuilt the project** (fresh production build)
3. ✅ **Added .nojekyll file** (prevents Jekyll processing)
4. ✅ **Deployed ONLY the built files** (not source code)
5. ✅ **Verified deployment** (correct structure confirmed)

---

## 📁 **CORRECT STRUCTURE NOW**

The gh-pages branch now contains:
```
✅ index.html        (main page)
✅ .nojekyll         (GitHub Pages config)
✅ assets/           (CSS & JavaScript)
  ├── index.css
  └── index.js
✅ vite.svg          (favicon)
```

**Previously had:** ❌ src/, node_modules/, and other source files (WRONG!)

**Now has:** ✅ Only built production files (CORRECT!)

---

## ⏱️ **WAIT 2-3 MINUTES**

GitHub Pages needs to rebuild and deploy the new files.

**Current time:** Just deployed now

**Expected live:** In 2-3 minutes

## 🔄 **WHAT TO DO NOW**

### **Step 1: Wait 2-3 minutes**
GitHub is processing the new deployment.

### **Step 2: Visit your website**
https://faizrasool75.github.io/DrSomaTask1/

### **Step 3: If still 404, hard refresh**
- **Windows:** `Ctrl + F5`

### **Step 4: Or try incognito/private window**
This bypasses any cached 404 pages.
