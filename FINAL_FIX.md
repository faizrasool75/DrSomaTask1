### Still getting 404 after configuration?

1. Wait 1-2 minutes
2. Hard refresh: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)  
3. Clear browser cache
4. Try incognito/private window

### Pages settings showing error?

- Make sure "Deploy from a branch" is selected

## 💡 **WHY IT WORKS NOW**

**Before:**

- ❌ Not configured properly

**After (Now):**

- ✅ Clean gh-pages branch with correct structure
- ✅ .nojekyll file added
- ✅ Properly built and deployed

**Only missing:** GitHub doesn't know to serve from gh-pages branch yet!
